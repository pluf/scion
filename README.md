A processing model to implement nonbloking server

## Concepts

- Process
- Unit
- Dataflow

### Process

Process is a php function

### Unit

Unit is a list of process.

An unit add a login and flow to process.

Default flow is sequensial, so, all process executed sequensially.


#### Labeled process

You may label a process for an special goal.

Build in label:

- condition: jumbs to the end of unit if the return value is false.

Note: condition processes are not joined to the data flow, but handnle flows.

### Dataflow

TO send data to the successor processes a container is used.

Each process can access resources which produced in previus process.

The backward data flow is generated by return values.
